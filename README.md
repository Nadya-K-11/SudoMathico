SudoMathico is like classic Sudoku, but not quite… Here is a but with a mathematical hint (if you need help)... 
The game is an educational version of classic Sudoku – with added mathematical challenges, a timer, points, and different difficulty levels. 
The board is a standard grid – 9 x 9 (81 cells), but to solve the puzzle you have a certain number of minutes and a certain number of empty cells depending on the difficulty level. You judge your strength yourself!

•	You can choose between 3 levels:
o	Easy: 20 empty cells, 15 minutes → 25 points (if you win)
o	Medium: 30 empty cells, 20 minutes → 50 points (if you win)
o	Hard: 40 empty cells, 30 minutes → 100 points (if you win)

•	If you are having a hard time, you can use Hint – a mathematical task that reveals the missing digit (costs -10 points). With each level, the math tasks become more complicated!
•	If you run out of time – you can add 5 minutes (costs -10 points).
•	You can pause the game anytime, or just restart the same puzzle.
•	Want a different shuffle? Press “New Game”!
•	Changing difficulty resets the board for the selected level.
•	Bonuses: You get 100 bonus points for registering and a Daily bonus of 20 points for entering the game! :)
•	You can see where you are in the rankings and statistics.
